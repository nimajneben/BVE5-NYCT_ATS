1 - Auto/App Triparm
2 - Homeball Triparm

#(all timer beacons take extra value as timer length in tenths second)

11 - 1GT timer start	
12 - ST timer start		

21 - 2GT Shot 1 Start
22 - 2GT Shot 2 Start / Shot 1 End
23 - 2GT Shot 2 End

for these beacons, you must place the timers in FIFO order.
(e.g.) at a point where 22 happens and 21 in another timer happens,
place 22 before 21.
